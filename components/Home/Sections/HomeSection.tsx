            <p>We are a community of aristocrats, who are not satisfied with being one more of the bunch. We were put in a corner, and everybody knows that when a dog gets cornered, it will bite! We will be part of the 1% and we will claim the position of Aristocrats that we have always deserved, overcoming any obstacle that stands in the way of achieving it.</p>
            <p>Inspired, driven, and led by the community, we are building a 100% utility project, with the goal of making a sustainable ecosystem for the Cronos blockchain family, the #CroFam.</p>
            <p>Each OG Dog it unique and was generated from +100 possible traits. Each trait is special and has a different % of occurrence, giving you the chance to own a unique AristoDog. Owning an AristoDog, grants you the absolute ownership of your NFT, and its commercial rights. </p>
            <p>Read our roadmap and come to be part of the AristoFamily. #KeepBarking üê∂</p>
